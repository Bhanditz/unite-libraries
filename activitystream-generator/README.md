## Activity Stream API

This file contains an API for publishing to an activity stream (partly based on http://activitystrea.ms/). The resulting stream will be an Atom feed with an activity extension in the "http://activitystrea.ms/spec/1.0/" namespace, which can be used to programatically analyze the feed.
