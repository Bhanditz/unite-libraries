## PSO (Pub-Sub Output)

**Note: since April 2012 development and support for Opera Unite has been discontinued. This includes the Opera Unite functionality inside the Opera desktop browser itself, as well as the Opera Unite servers that provided the public `user.operaunite.com` URLs.**

This library provides a simple pub/sub output, which replaces the functionality of opera.postError and allows developers to easily subscribe to the debug outputs they want.
