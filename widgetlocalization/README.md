## Widget Localization

widgetLocalization derives the user agent's locale using the algorithm found in http://www.w3.org/TR/widgets/#step-5--derive-the-user-agents-locale. You can then use the gettext library to retrieve and handle the appropriate language files for that locale, if they are available.
